Chat Application: Full-Stack Project Overview

The Chat Application project is a full-stack application built using React for the front-end and Express for the back-end. The application aims to create a seamless chatting experience for users with functionalities such as user registration, login, and real-time communication. This was a group project executed within 10 days, showcasing the ability to plan, design, and implement a fully functional application in a short time.

Key Features of the Chat Application :-

Login Functionality:
        Users can log in with their existing credentials.
        Authentication ensures secure access to their account and prevents unauthorized access.

Registration:
        New users can create an account by providing essential information, such as their username, password, and email.
        The registration process stores this data in a MongoDB database.

Add/Remove Friends:
        Users can send friend requests to others. Once accepted, users can add them as friends.
        Friends can be removed from the friend list at any time, giving users full control over their contacts.

Chat with Friends:
        The core feature of the app is the ability to send and receive messages in real-time.
        Users can send text messages to one another, which are displayed in the chat window immediately after sending.

Switch Chats:
        If a user has multiple ongoing conversations, they can switch between them with ease, allowing for quick access to any specific chat.
